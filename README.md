# SuperBackLogger
A command line environment for tracking your backlogs on whatever you want (games, movies, books, etc), written in Python. Mostly just an experiment for me to practice my Python skills.


Literally made this between 2 and 4am this morning (22/12/2017) because I couldn't get to sleep. Always annoyed I lose track of stuff I'm learning, so I made this to backlog it all.
Plan to add a bunch of features (some are mentioned in the --help bit), but I also want to add things like specific details on progress through something, maybe even add a nice little percentage bar to each item to show how far through you think you are.
And also for things like games, add some sub-fields for things like "number of secrets found, 57/100" or whatever.
